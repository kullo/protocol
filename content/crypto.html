title: Cryptography in Kullo

## Basic principles
* Don't roll your own algorithm!
  We use only established and battle-tested algorithms and follow recommendations from well-respected entities
  (for example [ENISA](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/algorithms-key-sizes-and-parameters-report)
  and [ECRYPT, NIST, ANSSI, BSI, ...](http://www.keylength.com/en/compare/)).
* Don't roll your own implementation!
  In our own client, we use [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) for everything but TLS.
  The latter is implemented in platform-specific ways:
  We use [Secure Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380123(v=vs.85).aspx) on Windows,
  [Secure Transport](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Reference/secureTransportRef/) on macOS and iOS,
  [OpenSSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL) on Linux and
  [javax.net.ssl](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html) on Android.
* Keep it simple!
  For example, we use authenticated encryption ([GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)) instead of implementing encrypt-then-MAC or MAC-then-encrypt.

## Choice of algorithms
Whenever we write about symmetric or asymmetric encryption or signatures, we mean the following algorithms, modes and parameters:

* symmetric encryption: AES-256 in GCM mode
* asymmetric encryption: RSA-4096 with OAEP(SHA-512) padding
* asymmetric signatures: RSA-4096 with PSS(SHA-512) padding

## Uses of cryptography

### Initialization vectors (IVs)
When we use symmetric encryption, we generally use a random IV of 128 bits.
We prepend this IV to the ciphertext, so the first 16 bytes of a symmetric ciphertext must be used as IV for decryption of the following data.

There are two exceptions to this rule:
The `content` and `attachments` fields of messages use fixed IVs.
See [Message format](message-format.html) for details.
This is secure because with GCM, reuse is only a problem if both key and IV are reused.

### Keys
Read about key hierarchy, generation and protection in Kullo: [Cryptographic keys](crypto_keys.html).
Private keys and the privateDataKey must be encrypted with the MasterKey before being uploaded.

The process of changing keys, for example in the event of key compromise, is described in [Changing keys](crypto_keychange.html).
However, none of this is finalized or implemented yet.

### Messages
Read about the encryption of messages in the [Message format reference](message-format.html).
