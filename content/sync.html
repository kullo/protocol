## Rationale

We invested a lot of work into making sure that a Kullo client is still usable when it is not connected to the internet.
Of course, you cannot send or receive messages while offline,
but you can browse received messages, mark them as done, save attachments to disk and write new message drafts.

All of this must be synced with the server when connectivity returns.
This comes with some complexity, most importantly in the notion of local and remote (server side) copies of a message.
In the following, we line out the steps necessary to communicate with a Kullo server.

## Synchronizing messages

### Downloading
First, [download a list of messages](http-api.html#get-a-list-of-messages) that where modified since last sync:

	GET /v1/jane.doe%23example.net/messages?modifiedAfter=1234567890

The value used for `modifiedAfter` should be the highest `lastModified` value that you received during an earlier download of this list.
If this is the first synchronization run, set modifiedAfter to 0 or leave it out.

If you'd like to receive not only the message IDs and modification timestamps,
but also the contents of messages (omitting attachments), set `includeData` to `true`.
You can also [download a message's contents](http-api.html#get-a-message) at a later time.

If `resultsReturned` is less than `resultsTotal`, simply re-run the query with updated modifiedAfter to download more messages.

### Processing received messages
Now that you downloaded messages from the server, you need to process them and probably merge local changes.

* If you need the public signature verification key of the sender to verify the message,
you can [download](http-api.html#get-a-public-key) it from the Kullo server responsible for the sender.
* Note that messages cannot be fully [deleted](http-api.html#delete-a-message) for synchronization reasons:
A tombstone record is left in place (with id and lastModified kept intact, and deleted set to true).
All other fields are cleared during deletion.
* The merging policy is this:
    * deletion always wins
    * `read`, `done`, and other potential fields in `meta`: local wins over remote modification

### Uploading local modifications
If there are local modifications to the messages, upload them to the server:

* [Modify meta](http-api.html#modify-message-meta)
* [Delete](http-api.html#delete-a-message)

For such a requests, use the lastModified value that you received when downloading the record.
Never change this timestamp locally, unless the server returns a new lastModified value for the message's ID.

A modification will fail if the modification timestamp in the request does not match the one known to the server.
This can happen if there was a concurrent modification of the message from another client.
In this case, the server will return a HTTP 409 (Conflict) status code.
Resync the message and try again, now with an updated timestamp.

In case of success, you get the new lastModified value that you should use to update the local message.


## Sending messages
In addition to all recipients, a message must also be [sent](http-api.html#sending-a-message) to the sender, so that it appears in the sender's inbox.
So, for a message with N recipients, it must be POSTed N+1 times.
The `content` and `attachments` fields (and the unencrypted contents of the `keySafe` field) can stay the same for all instances of a message.
The keySafe field, however, must be encrypted with the [latest public encryption key](http-api.html#get-a-public-key) of the current receiver.
