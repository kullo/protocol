## Common rules

* All fields must be filled with non-empty values
  (exception: fields with an empty default value).
* All strings are encoded in UTF-8.
* Times are given in RFC 3339 format (a subset of ISO 8601).
* Numbers are always stored in network byte order (big endian). This doesn't
  apply to JSON, which is a human readable format, so that numbers are
  represented by printable characters.

## Message

### Size limits
All size limits are given in KiB or MiB, also known as [kibibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte) or [mebibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte).

 * `keySafe`: 1 KiB
 * `content`: 128 KiB
 * `attachments`: 16 MiB (not the final value, will be increased)
 * `meta`: 1 KiB

### Field "keySafe"

Parameters
:	* msgFormat (uint32)
	* symmCipher (string)
	* symmKey (string)
	* hashAlgo (string)

`msgFormat` is fixed to 1.
`symmCipher` is fixed for msgFormat == 1.
`symmKey` is a base64-encoded random symmetric key. It must be usable for the
algorithm given in `symmCipher`. It must not be reused for multiple messages or
even for multiple copies of the same message.
`hashAlgo` is fixed for msgFormat == 1.

**Example:**

    {
        "msgFormat": 1,
        "symmCipher": "AES-256/GCM",
        "symmKey": "...",
        "hashAlgo": "SHA-512"
    }

#### Format

 * encode the JSON as UTF-8
 * encrypt the encoded JSON using RSA-4096/OAEP/SHA-512 and `pubEnc` of the receiver
 * concatenate the encryption key ID (uint32) and the encrypted JSON

### Field "content"

    {
        "sender": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "address": "john.doe#kullo.net",
            "organization": "Doe Corp.",         // optional, default: ""
            "avatar": {                          // optional, default: {}
                "mimeType": "...",               // "image/png" or "image/jpeg"
                "data": "..."                    // base64-encoded image file
                                                 // max. resolution: 200x200 px
            }
        },
        "recipients": [
            "alice#kullo.net",
            "bob#kullo.net"
        ],
        "dateSent": "2013-11-04T16:19:31+01:00",
        "text": "Here comes the message text.",  // optional, default: ""
        "footer": "Here comes the footer.",      // optional, default: ""
        "attachmentsIndex": [                    // optional, default: []
            {
                "filename": "my_first_file.pdf",
                "mimeType": "application/pdf",
                "note": "First file",            // optional, default: ""
                "size": 123456,
                "hash": "..."                    // SHA-512 of file content, hex format
            },
            {
                "filename": "my second file.jpg",
                "mimeType": "application/jpeg",
                "note": "Last file",
                "size": 1234567,
                "hash": "..."
            }
        }
    }

#### Format

 * encode the JSON as UTF-8
 * gzip-compress the encoded JSON
 * calculate a RSA-4096/PSS/SHA-512 signature of the compressed JSON, using
   `privSig` of the sender
 * concatenate the signature key ID (uint32), the signature length in bytes
   (uint32), the signature and the compressed JSON
 * encrypt the result using the algorithm `keySafe.symmCipher`, the static IV =
   `"content"` and the key `keySafe.symmKey`
 * base64-encode the encrypted data

### Field "attachments"

The `attachments` field contains all attachments as one binary block.

#### Format

*Attention!*
If the message doesn't contain any attachments,
or if it does only contain zero-length attachments,
the `attachments` field must be empty.

If there is at least one non-empty attachment, the following format is used:

 * concatenate all attachments' data in the order given in `content.attachmentsIndex`
 * gzip-compress the result
 * encrypt the compressed result using the algorithm `keySafe.symmCipher`, the
   static IV = `"attachments"` and the key `keySafe.symmKey`
 * base64-encode the encrypted data

### Field "meta"

    {
        "read": 1,
        "done": 0
    }

Note that we use `0` and `1`, not `false` and `true`. The reason is that `true`
has a different length than `false`, so that the values of read and done could
be inferred by looking at the length of the ciphertext.

#### Format

 * encode the JSON as UTF-8
 * encrypt the encoded JSON using AES-256/GCM, the `privateDataKey` and a random IV of
   128 bit (16 bytes)
 * concatenate the format version (uint32, fixed to 1), the IV and the encrypted
   JSON
