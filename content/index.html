title: The Open Kullo Protocol
---

One pillar of Kullo is transparency.
This includes that the communication between client and server follows an open protocol.
If you're interested in how Kullo works on a technical level, or you even want to implement your own client or server, please have a look at these docs.

If any part of this material is incomprehensible, incomplete, or even plain wrong, please let us know at hi#kullo.net. Or, if its easier for you, by email: Simply replace # by @.

## Warning
Some parts of the protocol are still in development and will most probably evolve over the next months.
A notable area that is bound to change is the handling of asymmetric key pairs, especially valid from/until dates and revocation.

## Components of the Kullo system
Kullo builds on a client-server architecture, using HTTP as the communication channel.
Kullo offers end-to-end encryption of messages, so that even the server has no access to message contents.
In addition to that, Kullo uses TLS for all client-server communication (HTTPS), which hides communication metadata from third parties.

### Kullo address
A Kullo address looks like this: `jane.doe#example.net`.
It is composed of the *local part* (`jane.doe`) and the *domain part* (`example.net`), separated by a hash sign (`#`).

Read the full [Kullo address specification](kullo_address.html) for more information.

### Servers
A Kullo server is basically a storage system with access control.
The domain part of a Kullo address determines which server should be responsible for the address:
It's the server with the FQDN `kullo.domain-part`.
For example, the messages for `jane.doe#example.net` are stored on `kullo.example.net`.
Clients communicate with Kullo servers through a RESTful [HTTP API](http-api.html).

### Clients
Due to end-to-end encryption, the client is where the more interesting things happen.
It is responsible for user registration and creating and handling keys,
it downloads, decrypts and verifies the user's messages and presents them to the user,
it synchronizes editable message metadata such as the *read* and *done* states of messages,
and it sends messages to other users.
