title: Text format for MasterKey
---

The MasterKey should be printed out by the user for password recovery.
It should be encoded as follows:

* Split 256 bit key into sixteen 16 bit blocks.
* Calculate their integer representation (big-endian) and pad with zeroes (00000-65535).
* Add one check digit for each 5-digit block ([Luhn mod N algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_mod_N_algorithm) with `N=10`).
* Arrange the 6-digit blocks into a square in left-to-right, top-to-bottom direction.

## Example

    -----BEGIN KULLO PRIVATE MASTER KEY-----
    Version: 1 (256 bit)
    
	009167 186544 520379 167502
	092114 170530 357103 015669
	422915 084699 505677 309062
	407924 293407 624445 483701
    -----END KULLO PRIVATE MASTER KEY-----

## Don't encode the MasterKey as a QR code!
It is not secure to generate QR codes of the given key!
Some (most?) QR code scanners automatically pass scanned information to other applications.
For example, the popular Android scanner [Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android) copies every scanned plaintext to the system clipboard by default, making it accessible to every other Android app running in the background.
Some apps might even launch internet searches without any user interaction.
