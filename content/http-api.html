[TOC]

## Common rules
* All API calls go through HTTPS.
* API paths are prefixed with the API version, which is currently `v1`.

Example: To get the messages of `jane.doe#example.net`, access `https://kullo.example.net/v1/jane.doe%23example.net/messages`.


## Sending a Message

### Authentication
No authentication required.
If you authenticate, you can also post `meta`
and you will get a non-empty response (see below for details).

### Post a new message to someone's inbox (without attachments)
This uses a JSON request body just like almost all other API endpoints. If you
want to send attachments, you need to use the multipart variant (see below).

Method
:	POST

Path
:	/$ADDRESS/messages

Body ([reference](message-format.html))
:	* keySafe (string, base64-encoded binary)
	* content (string, base64-encoded binary)

Additional body data (only with authentication)
:	meta (string, base64-encoded binary, optional)

**Response** (without authentication)

	â€“

**Response** (with authentication)

	id, lastModified, dateReceived

### Post a new message to someone's inbox (with or without attachments)
The body must not contain JSON but be of type multipart/form-data.

Method
:	POST

Path
:	/$ADDRESS/messages

Body ([reference](message-format.html))
:	* keySafe (application/octet-stream)
	* content (application/octet-stream)
	* attachments (application/octet-stream, optional)

Additional body data (only with authentication)
:	meta (application/octet-stream, optional)

Response: see above

#### Example

	Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=boundary

	--boundary
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="keySafe"
	Content-Type: application/octet-stream

	...binary keySafe...
	--boundary
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="content"
	Content-Type: application/octet-stream

	...binary content...
	--boundary
	Content-Disposition: form-data; name="meta"

## Push notifications

Please be aware that push notifications in the official Kullo apps are only available to users that use our Kullo server `kullo.kullo.net`.
This is a technical necessity, because the app and server are tightly coupled when implementing Google Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notifications.
You can only implement this in your own apps when combined with your own server.
Thus, this section is for informational purposes only.

### Authentication

See [Managing the inbox](#managing-the-inbox).
