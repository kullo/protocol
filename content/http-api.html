No authentication required.
If you authenticate, you can also post `meta`
and you will get a non-empty response (see below for details).

### Post a new message to someone's inbox
Method
:	POST

Path
:	/$ADDRESS/messages

Body ([reference](message-format.html))
:	* keySafe (string)
	* content (string)
	* attachments (string, optional)

Body (only with authentication)

Method
:	GET

Path
:	/$ADDRESS/keys/public

Query parameters
:	* date (datetime, optional)
	* type (string, optional)

**Response**

	for each key [with (validFrom <= date + 1d) and (validUntil >= date - 1d)]:
		id, type, pubkey, validFrom, validUntil, revocation

`type` is one of "enc" or "sig" for encryption or signature;
`revocation` holds a revocation certificate if the key was revoked

### Get a public key
Method
:	GET

Path
:	/$ADDRESS/keys/public/$ID

**Response**

	id, type, pubkey, validFrom, validUntil, revocation

`$ID` can be set to `latest-enc` to retrieve the latest public encryption key


## Managing the inbox

### Authentication

    resultsTotal (uint32)
    resultsReturned (uint32)
	data (array)
		id, lastModified, [deleted, dateReceived, meta, keySafe, content, hasAttachments]

The results are sorted by lastModified in ascending order.

#### Get a message
