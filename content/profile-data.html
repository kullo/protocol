## Common rules

The common rules from the [message format docs](message-format.html) also apply
to profile data.

## Profile data entries

 * `key`: string with up to 64 characters (see below)
 * `value`: string, maximum length is 64 KiB
 * `lastModified`: server-assigned numeric timestamp

The key must contain only lower-case unaccented latin characters, numbers and
underscores. It must NOT contain spaces, dashes or accented characters.
The corresponding regex character class is `[a-z0-9_]`.

Valid keys
:	* `name`: real name (string)
	* `organization`: organization/company (string)
	* `footer`: message footer/imprint (string)
	* `avatar_type`: MIME type of avatar (string, see [message format docs](message-format.html))
	* `avatar_data`: avatar data (binary, see [message format docs](message-format.html))
	* `mk_backup_reminder`: timestamp of next MasterKey backup reminder to be shown (datetime, optional)

Clients should remind the user of backing up his MasterKey if
`mk_backup_reminder` is in the past. If the user postpones the reminder, the
date should be set to some time in the future. If, however, the user did backup
his key, `mk_backup_reminder` should be set to an empty string.

### Encoding of values

 * represent the value as binary if it has a type other than binary:
   datetimes are serialized as an RFC3339 string, strings are encoded in their
   UTF-8 representation
 * encrypt value using AES-256/GCM, the `privateDataKey` and a random IV of
   128 bit (16 bytes)
 * concatenate the format version (uint32, fixed to 1), the IV and the encrypted
   value

When packaged in JSON, the keys are encoded as strings, while the encrypted
values are base64-encoded and then encoded as strings.
