**ATTENTION: This is currently only a design document; none of this is implemented!**

## Changing Symmetric Keys

* C: generate new `masterKey` and derive `loginKey`
* C: generate new `privateDataKey`
* C: encrypt `privateDataKey` with `masterKey`
* C->S: store `loginKey` and encrypted `privateDataKey`
* download, re-encrypt and upload all data that has been encrypted with `privateDataKey`


## Changing Asymmetric Keys

### Adding Key Pairs
* C: generate new encryption and signature key pairs
* C: encrypt PrivDec, PrivSign
* C->S: store new key pairs
* S: archive old keys, securely delete old PrivSign


## Recovery from Attacks

### Recovery after someone got to know any of the symmetric keys

#### If attacker didn't change the `loginKey`
In this case, the user can log in and use his account without restrictions. However, the attacker's access must be revoked:

* change `masterKey`, `loginKey` and `privateDataKey` as explained above
* revoke all valid key pairs
* add a new set of asymmetric keys

#### If attacker changed the `loginKey` AND user has an offline backup of the key pairs

* account gets locked
* user needs to authenticate with the provider (copy of passport etc.)
* key material added by attacker is removed but archived for decryption/verification of messages sent by the attacker
* if the `privateDataKey` was changed: provider deletes all data encrypted with (the attacker's) `privateDataKey`, as it cannot be recovered
* user gets a temporary `loginKey`
* account is reactivated
* proceed as if the attacker hadn't changed the password

#### If attacker changed the `loginKey` AND user doesn't have an offline backup of the key pairs

* account gets locked
* user needs to authenticate with the provider (copy of passport etc.)
* key material added by attacker is removed but archived for decryption/verification of messages sent by the attacker
* if the `privateDataKey` was changed: provider deletes all data encrypted with (the attacker's) `privateDataKey`, as it cannot be recovered
* provider deletes all messages, as they cannot be decrypted
* user gets a temporary `loginKey` to log in and overwrite the key material
* account is reactivated
